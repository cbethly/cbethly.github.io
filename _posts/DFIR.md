# Digital Forensics and Incidence Response
With the advent of modern computing and the widespread integration of digital technologies into our daily lives, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) have become indispensable components of cybersecurity. These practices are vital for investigating cyber incidents, identifying threats, and preserving digital evidence from various electronic devices. Understanding how devices store evidence is crucial for appreciating the significance of DFIR in today's digital age.

By now, you might be wondering what exactly is DFIR but before I explain what it is, let's first understand how digital devices store data.

## Understanding Digital Evidence Storage.
Modern electronic devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even IoT devices, store vast amounts of digital data. This data, which includes files, system logs, network traffic, application usage, and more, is stored in various formats on storage media like hard drives, solid-state drives, memory chips, and cloud storage. Digital evidence is preserved within these storage components, often in binary or encrypted formats. Processing this evidence will require Digital Forensics.
## What is Digital Forensics and Incidence Response?
It’s a Cyber Security field that encompasses two disciplines: Digital Forensics and Incident Response. Let's break down these two terms.

**Digital Forensics**:This is the process of investigating, analyzing, and documenting digital evidence that can be presented to a court of law.

**Incidence Response**:This is the process by which an organization quickly identifies an attack, minimizes its effects, contains damage, and remediates the cause to reduce the risk of future incidents. It is more focused on the containment of a threat or attack.

In order for us to understand further what DFIR is and what it entails, I'll provide a use case scenario that can be helpful. Below is the scenario.

#### Scenario
 In a small but critical healthcare facility, the operations came to a sudden halt as a crippling ransomware attack took control of the institution's computer systems. All crucial data, including patient records, appointment schedules, and vital medical information, was encrypted and rendered inaccessible.

 The above scenario necessitates DFIR and the team involved will seek to answer the following questions:

 1. Attribution:

 + Who is responsible for the attack, and can we identify the threat actors?
2. Incident Scope and Impact:

+ What is the complete extent and impact of this incident on our organization?

3. Attack Entry Point:

+ How did the attacker gain initial access to our systems?

4. Attack Escalation Steps:

+ What actions did the attacker take to escalate their control and operations?

5. Preventing Future Attacks:

+ What measures can we implement to prevent similar attacks in the future?

6. Full Remediation and Trust Restoration:

+ How can we comprehensively resolve the current issue and restore trust within our organization?

 It's important to note that digital evidence should meet the following key criteria.
 + It is admissible in court
 + It is authentic
 + It is complete
 + It is reliable
 + It is believable
 

 Having the above in mind, the following is the DFIR scientific process.

 ## Digital Forensics Process

1. **Identification:**
   + The initial phase in digital forensics involves identifying evidence and understanding its storage locations. This task demands profound technical expertise and analysis of digital media.

2. **Preservation:**
   + Following the identification of data, the subsequent step is to isolate, secure, and preserve all data until the investigation concludes. This encompasses compliance with regulatory or legal inquiries.

3. **Analysis:**

    Subsequently, the data undergoes comprehensive review and analysis employing the following techniques:
     + **File System Forensics:** Scrutinizing endpoint file systems for indicators of compromise (IoCs).
     + **Memory Forensics:** Examining memory for IoCs, often not visible in file systems.
     + **Network Forensics:** Analyzing network activity (emails, messages, web browsing history) to detect potential attacks. This step involves understanding the attacker’s methodologies and assessing the incident’s extent.
     + **Log Analysis:** Identifying unusual events or suspicious activities by scrutinizing and interpreting activity records or logs.

4. **Documentation:**
   + Relevant evidence is documented, which proves valuable when recreating incidents or crimes for in-depth investigations.

5. **Presentation:**
   + At the conclusion of the process, teams compile all evidence and findings in accordance with forensic protocols. This step typically encompasses presenting the analysis methodology and procedures.
 
## Incident Response Process
This process usually comes after the Digital forensics.

1. **Scoping:**
   + The initial step involves identifying all indicators of compromise (IoCs) and assessing the severity, scope, and extent of the incident.

2. **Investigation:**
   + Once the scope is defined, the investigation begins. Utilizing threat intelligence and advanced systems, threats are identified, evidence is gathered, and detailed information is obtained.

3. **Securing:**
   + Even after addressing specific threats, organizations must proactively search for security vulnerabilities and maintain continuous cyber health monitoring. This phase involves containing and eliminating active threats discovered during the investigation, as well as closing any identified security weaknesses.

4. **Assistance and Reporting:**
   + Every security event should ideally conclude with a comprehensive plan for ongoing support and personalized reporting. A DFIR service provider can assess the organization and offer expert guidance for subsequent actions.

5. **Transformation**
+ DFIR teams pinpoint deficiencies, offer recommendations to enhance areas of vulnerability, and address weaknesses to enhance the organization's overall security stance.

Now that we've looked at the process, why is it important?
